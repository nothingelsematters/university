Implement sorting of number sequences

You should implement three different sorting algorithms.

Provide implementation in `solve` function.
Use `words` function to split whole input to words and `readInt` to convert a word to an integer.

Your program will be given a sequence of integers (written to stdin).
First integer takes value from range [0..2] and signifies sorting algorithm to use.
Rest of integers is a sequence that is to be sorted.

You can compile and run your program with `cabal run practice1`.
